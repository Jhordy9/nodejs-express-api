# Node.js Express API

This project is a robust backend API built with Node.js and Express. It integrates the power of Prisma to offer a seamless database management experience.
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **[Node.js 16.x+](https://nodejs.org/)**: Ensure that Node.js version 16.x+ is installed.
2. **[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)**: This project utilizes Yarn for package management.
3. **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)** and **[Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**: Used for setting up and managing your development environment.

### Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the following to install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3. Fire up the necessary Docker containers using:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4. With **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)**, generate the Prisma client and execute the migrations:
    ```bash
    yarn db:generate
    yarn db:migrate
    ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Houses the primary source files.
- `prisma/`: Contains the Prisma schema, migration files, and other related configurations.
- `package.json`: Specifies the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Main Dependencies and Their Uses

- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)**: A database toolkit to facilitate type-safe database operations.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, perfect for building APIs.
- **[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)**: Useful for schema definition and validation.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **[Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)**: Super-agent driven library for testing HTTP servers.
- **[Hapi Boom](https://hapi.dev/module/boom/)**: Creates HTTP-friendly error objects.

## Possible Improvements

### Maintaining a Scalable and Maintainable Codebase

As projects grow, their complexity often increases, making maintainability a concern. To ensure the code remains scalable and maintainable, here are some recommended steps:

#### Modularization by Context

By breaking down the application into smaller, context-specific modules and sub-modules, it becomes more comfortable to manage and understand the code. Each module should handle a specific business logic or function of the application. For instance, if you have user-related functionalities (like registration, authentication, user profile management), they could all be within a `user` module. 

#### Utilizing Controllers for Routes

Instead of having all the route handlers within the route definitions, consider using controllers. Controllers will hold the business logic for each route, making the routes file cleaner and more straightforward. This separation ensures that if there's a need to change the underlying logic for a route, you'll only have to modify the controller, leaving the route definition untouched.

This design pattern not only improves readability but also ensures that each part of the application adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. In the long run, it aids in making debugging, testing, and adding new features more manageable.
